![](/assets/images/avatar-big.png) Hello! It's Li here. ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my website where I share my thoughts on technology and stuffs. They are purely for entertainment purposes and should never be taken seriously.

I have been mostly a software developer since 2003. In the last 10 years, I have built iOS apps for many organizations, such as News UK, HSBC, JustEat, Tide etc. If you leave in the UK, it is very likely that you have the apps I made(or was part of) on your iPhone.

I would not call myself a full stack developer, but I do develop backend and frontend code when I need to. 

I have also created a few startup projects, where I was normally the CTO or CEO, or both. 

`Writing the code, Changing the world` used to be my goal... Now it is pivoted to solve some problems people care enough about and having some fun along the way...

I sometimes call myself a serial entrepreneur when I was drunk or in the mood to make fun of my failed startup projects. I used to be able to count those using my hands. I stopped counting them nowadays.
